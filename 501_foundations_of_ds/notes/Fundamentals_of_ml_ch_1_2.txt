Fundamentals of Machine learning for predictive data analytics

1. Inductive Bias - the set of assumptions that defines the model selection criteria of a machine learning algorithm 
	a. restriction bias - the set of models that the algorithm considers during the learning process.
	b. preference bias - how the learning algorithm prefers some models over others.
	
2. Machine learning is an ill-posed problem because a single consistent model cannot be found on the basis of the sample training dataset alone. 

3. Inductive bias is reqwuired to make predictions for queries that are not present in the data.
This is referred to as generalization and the goal of ML is to find a model that best generalizes.

4. Problem of sampling bias - case study of literary digest predicting roosevelent would lose the election in 1936
because it only polled republican voters who had a phone available and only a fraction of those answered, 
so the sample was unrepresentative, even though the dataset was large.

5. Pitfalls of inductive biases 
underfitting and overfitting.
example:
	relationship between age and income 
methods:
	linear - underfitting 
	parabolic - appropriate
	polynomial regression - overfitting
