1. how do we make the business problem more complicated?
What does the thought process behind making it more granular as opposed 
to keeping it high level? could you set up time to walk through an example? 

	ex: availability of water in Italy 
	want to predict on rainstorms where water will be 
	
	>backtrack from problem 
	why are we specifically trying to do that?
	why would the business take interest in that? 
	
	we need to know what the water levels are so we can [xyz] 
	
	another ex: we want to know where a device fails so we can 
	send technicians for preventative measures 
	
	another ex: behavioral data for marketing 
	who's gonna click and buy something 
	you have to focus on why youre doing that, you get bumped 
	back into business understanding 

2. on data and information resources in the documentation:

write down how to get access, who to talk to, etc. 
(does that mean the script for an API call if its present?)

talk about cardinality and one-to-many relationships , etc.
